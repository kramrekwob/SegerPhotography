Tools:  HTML5, CSS3, JS, Jquery.  CSS Normalized and then used Sass for design.  <br/><br/>
Main Page links to 4 separate galleries that can be navigated through keys, clicks, or swipes.  Images scaled down quite a bit for more reasonable paint times.

Future Work: <br/>
-Add photos and additional galleries as client needs. <br/>
-Could further compress a few images for faster loadtimes, use srcset for larger images for larger screens <br/>
-Could integrate instagram photos automatically, would have to change the aspect ratios. <br/>
